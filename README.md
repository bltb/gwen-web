Gwen-web
========

Gwen-web is a web automation engine that runs inside the 
[Gwen](https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen) interpreter. 
It allows teams to automate front end web tests by writing 
[Gherkin](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/wiki/Gherkin) feature 
specifications instead of code.
