1.2.0
=====
Feb 17, 2016, 12:07 AM GMT+11 (AEDT)
- Added new DSLs for starting and closing browser sessions:
  - I start a new browser session
  - I close the current browser session
- Added support for performing actions on context sensitive elements 
  that are available only when another element is moved into first. 
  This is supported through the following DSL: 
  - I <click|check|uncheck> <element> of <context>
   
1.1.1
=====
Feb 16, 2016, 12:43 PM GMT+11 (AEDT)
- Fixed #17 - Do nothing when checking/unchecking checkboxes or radio 
  buttons that are already checked or unchecked respectively 
  - Solution was to move the guards from the check and uncheck 
    pattern match clauses to their bodies instead

1.1.0
=====
Feb 11, 2016, 11:47 PM GMT+11 (AEDT)
- Added support for chaining locators through new DSL:
  - <element> can be located by <locator> "<expression>" in <container>
  - Where <container> can be 
    - An element
      - In this case <element> is located within the <container> element
    - A frame
      - In this case <element> is located within the page in the <container> 
        frame  
      - The WebEnvContext.withElement function will restore the previous window 
        in the web driver if the location of the element within the frame 
        fails on the first attempt. 
  - All element lookups and operations now occur inside the
    WebEnvContext.withElement function. This is where all 1st and 2nd lookup 
    attempts occur and where switching to the previous window is performed 
    when operations on elements are completed. The web engine no longer 
    calls the locator methods directly (it now calls withElement instead).
- Simplified assertion error messages
- Update selenium webdriver from v2.48.1 to v2.51.0
- Update Gwen from v1.0.1 to v[1.0.3](https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen/releases/tag/v1.0.3)

1.0.2
=====
Jan 29, 2016, 5:13 PM GMT+11 (AEDT)
- Fixed problem with 1.0.1 release which had a snapshot dependency to Gwen
  in the maven POM file.

1.0.1
=====
Jan 26, 2016, 11:43 PM GMT+11 (AEDT)
- Resolved gwen-interpreter/gwen#15 - Use compact report attachment names
- Update Gwen from v1.0.0 to v[1.0.1](https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen/releases/tag/v1.0.1)
